The menu should provide the following methods:

public void addMeal(String meal) adds a meal to the menu. If the meal is already on the list, it should not be added again.
public void printMeals() prints the meals.
public void clearMenu() clears the menu.

Adding a Meal
Implement the public void addMeal(String meal) method, which adds a new meal to the meals list. 
If the meal you want to add is already on the list, you shouldn't add it again. 

Printing the Meals
Implement the public void printMeals() method, which prints the meals. 



Clearing the Food List
Implement the public void clearMenu() method, which clears the menu. 


import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Menu {

    private ArrayList<String> meals;

    public Menu() {
        this.meals = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    // implement the required methods here
    public void addMeal(String meal){
        if (!this.meals.contains(meal)){
            this.meals.add(meal);
        }
    }
    public void printMeals(){
        for (String meal: this.meals){
            System.out.println(meal);
        }
    }
    public void clearMenu(){
        meals.clear();
    }
    
}
