# Your assignment is to modify the program so that instead of the first value, the third value on the list is printed. 
Remember that programmers start counting from zero! 
The program is allowed to malfunction if there are fewer than three entries on the list, so you don't need to prepare for such an event at all.


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ThirdElement {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        while (true) {
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            if (input.equals("")) {
                break;
            }

            list.add(input);
        }

        System.out.println(list.get(2));
    }
}
