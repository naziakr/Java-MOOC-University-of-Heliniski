# In the exercise template there is a program that reads inputs from the user and adds them to a list. Reading is stopped once the user enters an empty string.

Your task is to modify the method to print the last read value after it stops reading. Print the value that was read last from the list. 


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class LastInList {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        while (true) {
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            if (input.equals("")) {
                break;
            }

            list.add(input);
        }
        System.out.println(list.get(list.size()-1));

    }
}
