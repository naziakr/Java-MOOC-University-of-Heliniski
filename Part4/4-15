Create a class Statistics that has the following functionality (the file for the class is provided in the exercise template):

a method addNumber adds a new number to the statistics
a method getCount tells the number of added numbers
The class does not need to store the added numbers anywhere, it is enough for it to remember their count. 
At this stage, the addNumber method can even neglect the numbers being added to the statistics, since the only thing being stored is the count of numbers added.

the sum method tells the sum of the numbers added (the sum of an empty number statistics object is 0)
the average method tells the average of the numbers added (the average of an empty number statistics object is 0

public class Statistics {

    private int count;
    private int sum;

    public Statistics() {
        this.count = count;
        this.sum = sum;
    }

    public void addNumber(int number) {
        this.count++;
        this.sum += number;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return this.count = count;
    }

    public int sum () {
        return this.sum = sum;
    }

    public double average() {
        if (this.count != 0) {
            return (double) this.sum / this.count;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
