# First, create the PaymentCard object's constructor, which is passed the opening balance of the card, and which then stores that balance in the object's 
internal variable. 
Then, write the toString method, which will return the card's balance in the form "The card has a balance of X euros".

The method eatAffordably should reduce the card's balance by € 2.60, and the method eatHeartily should reduce the card's balance by € 4.60.

Change the methods eatAffordably and eatHeartily so that they don't reduce the balance should it turn negative.
The purpose of the method is to increase the card's balance by the amount of money given as a parameter. 
However, the card's balance may not exceed 150 euros. 
As such, if the amount to be topped up exceeds this limit, the balance should, in any case, become exactly 150 euros.


public class PaymentCard {
    private double balance;

    public PaymentCard(double openingBalance) {
        this.balance = openingBalance;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "The card has a balance of "+this.balance+" euros";
    }
    public void eatAffordably() {
        if (this.balance > 2.60){
            this.balance = this.balance-2.60;
        } 
   
    }

    public void eatHeartily() {
        if (this.balance > 4.60){
        this.balance = this.balance-4.60;
        } 
    
    }
    
    public void addMoney(double amount){
        if (amount>0){
            if (this.balance+amount>100.0){
                this.balance = 150.0;
            } else{
                this.balance = this.balance+amount;
            }
        }
    }
