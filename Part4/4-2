# The Account from the previous exercise class is also available in this exercise.

Write a program that:

Creates an account named "Matthews account" with the balance 1000
Creates an account named "My account" with the balance 0
Withdraws 100.0 from Matthew's account
Deposits 100.0 to "my account"
Prints both the accounts

/* 
 * DO NOT TOUCH THIS !
 */

public class Account {

    private double balance;
    private String owner;

    public Account(String owner, double balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
        this.owner = owner;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        this.balance = this.balance + amount;
    }

    public void withdrawal(double amount) {
        this.balance = this.balance - amount;
    }

    public double balance() {
        return this.balance;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.owner + " balance: " + this.balance;
    }
}



public class YourFirstBankTransfer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Do not touch the code in Account.java
        // write your program here
        Account matthewsAccount = new Account("Matthews account", 1000.0);
        Account myAccount = new Account("My account", 0.0);
        matthewsAccount.withdrawal(100);
        myAccount.deposit(100);
        System.out.println(matthewsAccount);
        System.out.println(myAccount);
    }
}
