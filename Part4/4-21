Write a program that reads strings from the user until the user inputs the string "end". At that point, the program should print how many strings have been read.
The string "end" should not be included in the number strings read. 


import java.util.Scanner;

public class NumberOfStrings {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int counter = 0;
        while (true){
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            if (input.equals("end")){
                break;
            } else{
                counter = counter+1;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(counter);

    }
}
