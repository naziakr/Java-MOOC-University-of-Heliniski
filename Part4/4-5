# Create a class named Whistle. Add the variable private String sound to the class.
After that, create the constructor public Whistle(String whistleSound), which is used to create a new whistle that's given a sound.

Then create the method public void sound() that prints the whistle's sound.


public class Whistle {
    private String sound;
    public Whistle(String whistleSound){
        this.sound = whistleSound;
    }
    
public void sound(){
    System.out.println(this.sound);
}
}
