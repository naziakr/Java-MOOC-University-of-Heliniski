In the exercise base there is a class called Song that can be used to create new objects that represent songs. 
Add to that class the equals method so that the similarity of songs can be examined.


public class Song {

    private String artist;
    private String name;
    private int durationInSeconds;

    public Song(String artist, String name, int durationInSeconds) {
        this.artist = artist;
        this.name = name;
        this.durationInSeconds = durationInSeconds;
    }
    
    public boolean equals(Object compared) {
        if (this == compared){
            return true;
        }
        
        if (!(compared instanceof Song)) {
            return false;
        }
        Song comparedSong = (Song) compared;
         
        if(this.artist.equals(comparedSong.artist) &&
           this.name.equals(comparedSong.name) &&
           this.durationInSeconds == comparedSong.durationInSeconds){
        return true;
        }else {
                return false;
            }
    }
    

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.artist + ": " + this.name + " (" + this.durationInSeconds + " s)";
    }


}
