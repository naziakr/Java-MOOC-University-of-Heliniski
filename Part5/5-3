Create a Cube class that represents a cube (i.e., a standard hexahedron). Create a public Cube (int edgeLength) constructor for the class,
that takes the length of the cube's edge as its parameter.

Make a public int volume() method for the cube, which calculates and returns the cube's volume. 
The volume of the cube is calculated with the formula edgeLength * edgeLength * edgeLength. 
Moreover, make a public String toString() method for the cube, which returns a string representation of it. 
The string representation should take the form "The length of the edge is l and the volume v", 
where l is the length and v the volume - both the length and volume must be represented as integers.


public class Cube {
    private int length;
    
    public Cube (int edgeLength){
        this.length = edgeLength;
    }
    public int volume(){
        return this.length*this.length*this.length;
    }
    
    public String toString(){
        return "The length of the edge is "+this.length+" and the volume "+this.volume();
    }
}
