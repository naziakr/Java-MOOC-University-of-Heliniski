The Karvonen method allows you to calculate your target heart rate for physical exercise. 
The target heart rate is calculated with the formula (maximum heart rate - resting heart rate) * (target heart rate percentage) + resting heart rate, 
where the target heart rate is given as a percentage of the maximum heart rate.
For example, if a person has a maximum heart rate of 200, a resting heart rate of 50, and a target heart rate of 75% of the maximum heart rate, 
the target heart rate should be about ((200-50) * (0.75) + 50), i.e., 162.5 beats per minute.

Create a class called Fitbyte. Its constructor takes both an age and a resting heart rate as its parameters. 
The exercise assistant should provide a method targetHeartRate, 
which is passed a number of type double as a parameter that represents a percentual portion of the maximum heart rate. 
The proportion is given as a number between zero and one. The class should have:

A constructor public Fitbyte(int age, int restingHeartRate)
A method public double targetHeartRate(double percentageOfMaximum) that calculates and returns the target heart rate.



public class Fitbyte {
    private int age;
    private int heartRate;
    
    public Fitbyte(int age, int restingHeartRate){
        this.age = age;
        this.heartRate = restingHeartRate;
    }
    
    public double maxHeartRate(){
        return 206.3 - (0.711 * this.age);
    }
    
    public double targetHeartRate(double percentageOfMaximum){
        return (maxHeartRate() - this.heartRate) * (percentageOfMaximum) + this.heartRate;
    }
    
}
