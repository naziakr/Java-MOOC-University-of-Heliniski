mplement a class called Counter. The class contains a number whose value can be incremented and decremented. 
The class must have the following constructors:

public Counter(int startValue) sets the start value of the counter to startValue.
public Counter() sets the start value of the counter to 0.
And the following methods:

public int value() returns the current value of the counter
public void increase() increases the value by 1
public void decrease() decreases the value by 1


Alternative methods
Implement versions which are given one parameter of the methods increase and decrease.

public void increase(int increaseBy) increases the value of the counter by the value of increaseBy.
If the value of increaseBy is negative, the value of the counter does not change.
public void decrease(int decreaseBy) decreases the value of the counter by the value of decreaseBy. 
If the value of decreaseBy is negative, the value of the counter does not change.
