The method receives a person as a parameter, and it is meant to return to its caller the weight of that person.
The weight information can be found by calling a suitable method of the person person. So your task is to complete the code of the method!



Feeding
Write a method called public void feed(Person person) for the health station. It should increase the weight of the parameter person by one.


Counting weighings
Create a new method called public int weighings() for the health station. It should tell how many weighings the health station has performed. 


public class HealthStation {
    
    private int counter;


    public int weigh(Person person) {
        // return the weight of the person passed as the parameter
        counter++;
        return person.getWeight();
        
    }
    public void feed(Person person){
        person.setWeight(person.getWeight()+1);
    }
    
    public int weighings(){
        return counter;
        
    }

}
