Create a Gift class, where the objects instantiated from it represent different kinds of gifts. The information that's recorded is the name and weight of the item (kg).

Add the following methods to the class:

Constructor for which the name and weight of the gift are given as parameters
Method public String getName(), which returns the name of the gift
Method public int getWeight(), which returns the weight of the gift
Method public String toString(), which returns a string in the form "name (weight kg)"


Package-class
Create a Package class to which gifts can be added, and that keeps track of the total weight of the gifts in the package. The class should contain:

A parameterless constructor
Method public void addGift(Gift gift), which adds the gift passed as a parameter to the package. The method returns no value.
Method public int totalWeight(), which returns the total weight of the package's gifts.


public class Gift {
    private String name;
    private int weight;
    
    public Gift(String name, int weight){
        this.name = name;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
    public String getName(){
        return this.name;
    }
    
    public int getWeight(){
        return this.weight;
    }
    public String toString(){
        return this.name+" ("+ this.weight+") kg";
    }
}

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Package {

    private ArrayList<Gift> gifts = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addGift (Gift gift) {
        this.gifts.add(gift);
    }

    public int totalWeight () {
        int sum = 0;
        for (Gift gift : gifts) {
            sum += gift.getWeight();
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
