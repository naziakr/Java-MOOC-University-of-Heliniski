Implement the class TextUI that receives as constructor parameters a Scanner and SimpleDictionary objects. Then give the class a method called public void start().
The method should work as follows:

The method asks the user for a command
If the command is end, the UI prints the string "Bye bye!" and the execution of the start method ends.
Otherwise the text UI prints the message Unknown command and asks for a new command, so it loops back to step 1.


Adding a translation
Modify the method public void start() so that it works in the following way:

The method asks the user for a command.
If the command is end, the UI prints the string "Bye bye!" and the execution of the start method ends.
If the command is add, the text UI asks the user for a word and a translation, each on its own line. 
After this the words are stored in the dictionary, and the method continues by asking for a new command (loops back to stage 1).
Otherwise the text UI prints the message Unknown command and asks for a new command, so it loops back to step 1.


In the example above, we added the word "pike" and its translation "hauki" to the SimpleDictionary object. 
After exiting the text user interface the dictionary could be used in the following manner:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
SimpleDictionary dictionary = new SimpleDictionary();

TextUI textUI = new TextUI(scanner, dictionary);
textUI.start();
System.out.println(dictionary.translate("pike")); // prints the string "hauki"
Translating a word
Modify the method public void start() so that it works in the following:

The method asks the user for a command.
If the command is end, the UI prints the string "Bye bye!" and the execution of the start method ends.
If the command is add, the text UI asks the user for a word and a translation, each on its own line.
After this the words are stored in the dictionary, and the method continues by asking for a new command (loops back to stage 1).
If the command is search, the text UI asks the user for the word to be translated. 
After this it prints the translation of the word, and the method continues by asking for a new command (loops back to stage 1).
Otherwise the text UI prints the message Unknown command and asks for a new command, so it loops back to step 1.


Cleaning up the translation
Modify the searching functionality of the UI so that if the word isn't found (i.e. the dictionary returns null), 
the UI prints the message "Word (searched word) was not found".



import java.util.HashMap;

public class SimpleDictionary {

    private HashMap<String, String> translations;

    public SimpleDictionary() {
        this.translations = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public String translate(String word) {
        return this.translations.get(word);
    }

    public void add(String word, String translation) {
        this.translations.put(word, translation);
    }
}
import java.util.Scanner;

    public TextUI(Scanner scanner, SimpleDictionary simpleDictionary){
        this.scanner = scanner;
        this.simpleDictionary = simpleDictionary;
    }
    
    public void start(){
        while (true){
            System.out.println("Command: ");
            String input = scanner.nextLine();
            if (input.equals("end")){
                System.out.println("Bye bye!");
                break;
            } else if (input.equals("add")){
                System.out.println("Word: ");
                String word = scanner.nextLine();
                System.out.println("Translation: ");
                String translation = scanner.nextLine();
                simpleDictionary.add(word, translation);
                continue;
            } else if (input.equals("search")){
                System.out.println("To be translated: ");
                String toBeTranslated = scanner.nextLine();
               
                String translation = simpleDictionary.translate(toBeTranslated);
                if (translation == null){
                    System.out.println("Word "+ toBeTranslated+ " was not found");
                } else{
                    System.out.println("Translation: ");
                    System.out.println(translation);
                }
                continue;
            } else {
                System.out.println("Unknown command");
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Bye bye!");
    }
}
