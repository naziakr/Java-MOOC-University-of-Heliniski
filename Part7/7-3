Create in the class MainProgram a class method smallest that takes an integer array as a parameter. It should return the smallest value in the array.

Index of the smallest value
Create a method called indexOfSmallest in the class MainProgram. It should return the index of the smallest number in the array that it receives as a parameter.

Index of the smallest value after a certain value
Create in the class MainProgram a class method called indexOfSmallestFrom.
It works similarly to the method in the previous section, but only considers the table values from a certain index forwards. 
In addition to the table, it receives this start index as a parameter.

Swapping numbers
Create a class method swap in the class MainProgram. It receives as its parameters an array and two indices inside it. 
The method swaps the numbers in these indices with each other.
Sorting
We have now assembled a set of useful methods. With their help, we can implement a sorting algorithm known by the name of selection sort.

The idea of selection sort is:

Move the smallest number in the array to index 0.
Move the second smallest number to index 1.
Move the third smalles number in the array to index 2.
Etc.

Implement a class method called sort based on the idea above in the class MainProgram.
It should include a loop that goes through the indices of the array. Certainly the method indexOfSmallestFrom and swap will come in handy. 
Additionally, print the contents of the array before sorting and after every iteration of the loop to ensure that the algorithm works as you expect it to.

import java.util.Arrays;
public class MainProgram {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // write your test code here
        int[] array = {3, 1, 5, 99, 3, 12};
    }
    
    public static int smallest(int[] array){
    int small = array[0];
    for (int number: array){
        if (number<small){
        small = number;
        } 
    } return small;
    } 
    public static int indexOfSmallest(int[] array){
        int small = array[0];
        int count = 0;
        int index = 0;
        for (int number: array){
        if (number<small){
        small = number;
        index = count;
        } count = count+1;
    }  return index;
        
    }
    public static int indexOfSmallestFrom(int[] table, int startIndex) {
        int small = table[startIndex];
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = startIndex; i<table.length; i++){
            if (table[i]<=small){
                small = table[i];
                index = i;
            }
        } return index;
    }
    
    public static void swap(int[] array, int index1, int index2) {
        int temp = array[index1];
        array[index1] = array[index2];
        array[index2] = temp;
    }
    
    public static void sort(int[] array) {
        System.out.print("Before sort:");
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(array));

        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {

            swap(array,i , indexOfSmallestFrom(array, i));

            System.out.println("After " + i+ " sort " + Arrays.toString(array));

        }

    
    }
}
